### Imperfect Banking Competition and the Propagation of Uncertainty Shocks
**Awards**:  IFABS Best PhD Paper Award 
<br/>
<ins>Abstract</ins>: This paper studies how the intensity of competition in the banking sector affects the propagation of uncertainty shocks. Analyzing a panel dataset of 44 country, I show that an increase in uncertainty has a stronger negative impact on output growth when banking competition is lower. In order to explain this fact, I build a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with imperfect banking competition and financial frictions. In the model, entrepreneurs and imperfectly competitive banks engage in a loan contract and entrepreneurs receive idiosyncratic productivity shocks. When banking competition is lower, banks charge higher loan rates to their borrowers making borrowers more fragile. Because of higher borrower fragility, uncertainty shocks to entrepreneurial productivity have stronger negative effects on defaults, investment and output when banking competition is lower. The result holds also in an economy with heterogeneous banks.

### Firm risk shocks and the banking accelerator, with _Vivien Lewis, St√©phane Moyen and Stefania Villa_
<ins>Abstract</ins>:   Increases in firm default risk raise the default probability of banks in US data. We analyse firm risk shocks in a New Keynesian business cycle model, where entrepreneurs and banks engage in a loan contract and both are subject to idiosyncratic default risk. In the model, a wave of corporate defaults leads to losses on banks' balance sheets, thereby increasing bank defaults. A more leveraged banking sector exacerbates the contractionary effects of firm risk shocks, acting as a `banking accelerator'. We study macroprudential policy in the form of a penalty on excessive bank leverage. Such a penalty increases bank capital buffers, helping to dampen the effects of risk shocks.

### Capital Requirements, Bank Competition and Stability
<ins>Abstract</ins>:   A large theoretical literature argues that bank competition decreases bank margins causing higher bank risk of default (margin effect). This argument does not consider the effect of bank equity. Equity protects banks from losses and makes the margin effect negligible. Furthermore, higher competition implies lower loan rates that decrease borrowers' risk incentives (risk-shifting effect). If bank equity is high enough, the margin effect becomes weaker than the risk-shifting effect and bank risk decreases with competition. Consequently, if the risk-shifting effect is high enough, the optimal capital requirement can decrease with competition because lower capital requirements are needed with high competition.
