<ins>Abstract</ins>: Uncertainty shocks play a crucial role in driving business cycle fluctuations. This paper investigates the impact of changes in banking competition on the propagation of uncertainty shocks. Using a panel dataset of 44 countries, I show that lower banking competition amplifies the negative impact of uncertainty on output growth. I further explore this relationship through a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model featuring imperfect banking competition and financial frictions. The model shows that lower banking competition leads to higher borrowing rates and increased risk-taking by entrepreneurs. As a result, when the number of competitors decreases, uncertainty shocks have a stronger negative impact on defaults, investment and output due to increased risk-taking.

## Work in Progress
### Firm risk shocks and the banking accelerator, with _Vivien Lewis, St√©phane Moyen and Stefania Villa_
<ins>Abstract</ins>:   Increases in firm default risk raise the default probability of banks in US data. We analyse firm risk shocks in a New Keynesian business cycle model, where entrepreneurs and banks engage in a loan contract and both are subject to idiosyncratic default risk. In the model, a wave of corporate defaults leads to losses on banks' balance sheets, thereby increasing bank defaults. A more leveraged banking sector exacerbates the contractionary effects of firm risk shocks, acting as a `banking accelerator'. We study macroprudential policy in the form of a penalty on excessive bank leverage. Such a penalty increases bank capital buffers, helping to dampen the effects of risk shocks.


### Capital Requirements, Bank Competition and Stability
<ins>Abstract</ins>:   A large theoretical literature argues that bank competition decreases bank margins causing higher bank risk of default (margin effect). This argument does not consider the effect of bank equity. Equity protects banks from losses and makes the margin effect negligible. Furthermore, higher competition implies lower loan rates that decrease borrowers' risk incentives (risk-shifting effect). If bank equity is high enough, the margin effect becomes weaker than the risk-shifting effect and bank risk decreases with competition. Consequently, if the risk-shifting effect is high enough, the optimal capital requirement can decrease with competition because lower capital requirements are needed with high competition.
