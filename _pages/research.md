### [Capital Requirements, Bank Competition and Stability](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18ajQdfohcBFdpHF3FUoBXjrZ6wo0z8SI/view?usp=sharing)
<ins>Abstract</ins>:   A large theoretical literature argues that bank competition decreases bank margins causing higher bank risk of default (margin effect). This argument does not consider the effect of bank equity. Equity protects banks from losses and makes the margin effect negligible. Furthermore, higher competition implies lower loan rates that decrease borrowers' risk incentives (risk-shifting effect). If bank equity is high enough, the margin effect becomes weaker than the risk-shifting effect and bank risk decreases with competition. Consequently, if the risk-shifting effect is high enough, the optimal capital requirement can decrease with competition because lower capital requirements are needed with high competition.
